# SmartMeal - Your AI Recipe Recommendation Engine

Tired of recipe boredom and endless scrolling? We were too. SmartMeal was inspired by the frustration of finding truly delicious and personalized meal ideas.

## What it does

SmartMeal is your personal AI recipe recommendation engine. Tell us your taste and dietary needs, and we instantly suggest craveable recipes tailored just for you. Discover new favorites and simplify meal planning!

## How we built it

We built SmartMeal using:

*   **Backend:** NextJS
*   **Frontend:** React
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL
*   **AI Recommendation Engine:** Perplexity AI

## Challenges we ran into

Building a truly personalized engine with a limited initial recipe database was a challenge. We overcame this by focusing on smart algorithms and user feedback to ensure relevant recommendations from day one.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud to have a functional MVP that delivers personalized recipes, a smooth user experience, and a working AI recommendation engine. The core features are all working and ready for user testing!

## What we learned

We learned valuable lessons about applying machine learning to recommendations, the importance of MVP feature prioritization, and the power of user-centric design even in early development.

## What's next for SmartMeal

Next for SmartMeal:

*   Expand our recipe database.
*   Enhance our AI for smarter suggestions.
*   Add meal planning features.
*   Integrate with our previous project, SmartExpense! This means SmartMeal will estimate recipe costs, and you can track actual spending via SmartExpense. This powerful combination will help you eat better and manage your food budget effectively.
